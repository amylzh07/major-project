# CS30 Major Project

## Project Description
Brainstorming Ideas Down Below:
- Pinball (utilizes physics for collisions and pathways)
- 8 Ball (similarly collisions between bodies) I like this one the best
- Watermelon Game (physics for gravity, such as when fruit collide)

## Needs to Have
- Some things

## Nice to Have
- More things

Low floor (having something that's easy to start) and high ceiling (a project that is expandable).
- Render terrain / game surface
- Develop objects
- Research behaviors
