# CS30 Major Project

## Project Description
A music-inspired pinball machine that blends the mechanics of pinball with the beats of rhythm games. After launching the pinball, the various obstacles in the machine will emit different sounds and colors when collisions occur.

## Needs to Have
- The pinball machine "terrain" ( :white_check_mark: )
- Minimum 5 obstacles in the machine ( :white_check_mark: )
- A pinball object with physics in its behaviour (:white_check_mark:)
- Toggle that drops the ball into the machine (free-fall) (REPLACED WITH LAUNCHPAD) (:white_check_mark:)
- 2 flippers to control the pinball's motion (:white_check_mark:)
- Working collisions between the pinball, obstacle, and flipper objects (:white_check_mark:)
- Sounds and colors with each obstacle (:white_check_mark:)
- Game music in the background (:white_check_mark:)
- Loading screen, play screen, and end screen

## Nice to Have
- Launchpad that boosts the pinball into the machine rather than drops it (implemented with pressing space) (:white_check_mark:)
- Different forces hitting the pinball depending on how low the launchpad is set
- Select different music for different machines (having more than 1 machine that players can play)
- Camera animation that follows the ball's movement
- Highscores for all players (local storage) (:white_check_mark:)
- Possible 3D terrain and corresponding physics
