# CS30 Major Project

## Project Description
Brainstorming Ideas Down Below:
- Pinball (utilizes physics for collisions and pathways)
- Pool (similarly collisions between bodies) I like this one the best

## Needs to Have
- Different ball objects with collision behaviors
- Pool table setup
- Pool cue objects
- Score chart
- Player turns

## Nice to Have
- Multiplayer through p5.play

Low floor (having something that's easy to start) and high ceiling (a project that is expandable).
- Render terrain / game surface
- Develop objects
- Research behaviors
